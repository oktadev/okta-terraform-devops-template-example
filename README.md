## Create accounts

Create a free Okta Developer Edition account. In the Okta dashboard, create an API Services application using a public/private key pair generated by Okta. Enable `okta.groups.manage` scope and add `Organization Administrator` as an admin role.

In the AWS account, set up an S3 bucket, a DynamoDB Table, and use Secrets Manager for the private key.

In the GitHub account, create a new repository using this project as the template.

## Configure variables

Update the `backend-*.conf` and `tfvars` files and replace variables with values from your Okta domain, AWS account, and GitHub.
